# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

This project is to display how to work with the back end databases and working with Express.JS and MongoDB. The functionality of this project is to create, update, and delete items and users using the back end databases instead of coding it in the front end.

In this project, the technologies used are Express.JS, MongoDB, and then using Postman and Mongo Compass for error checking and database resolution.

## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing
Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
